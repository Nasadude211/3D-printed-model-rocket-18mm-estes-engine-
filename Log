1. Idea created Wednesday, January 21st at approximately 2:00 PM (G period, when I had the idea). I started the first file.

2. Saturday, January 24th at approximately 1:00 PM, I started finishing the CAD files.

3. Sunday, January 25th at 12:00 PM, I started the print. At 12:23 PM, I noticed that the print file was corrupted on the LCD screen and began troubleshooting.

4. Sunday, January 25th at 1:10 PM, I realized that I had improperly ejected my USB flash drive from my MacBook, which caused the corruption—an easy fix.

5. Sunday, January 25th at 1:23 PM, I finished recreating the files and also edited the nose cone file, then left to eat lunch.

6. Sunday, January 25th at 6:33 PM, I came back to the printer and saw that the file was not corrupted and had successfully printed, but the tip of the nose cone was broken.

I realized that a feature I added to help me actually backfired I made the inside of the nose cone hollow to reduce dead weight, but this prevented the tip from fully printing 

and caused it to fill up with resin. This eliminated the whole purpose of the feature and was quite a setback, since it was now Sunday night and I only had time for about one 

more print before the school week started again and all of my time would be taken away.
