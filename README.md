3D-Printed Model Rocket

This project is a homemade 3D printed model rocket powered by a standard 18 mm Estes motor. The rocket was designed and built in TinkerCAD as a fun, way to do some  model rocketry and 3D printing on the weekend.
The goal of the project was to create a simple rocket that could actually fly while being fully printable on a small resin printer. The design includes a main body , engine mount, a cone shaped nose, and four fins. It’s compact and lightweight, making it ideal for hobby launches and experiments.
This project was done primarily for learning and experimentation, giving experience with CAD modeling, resin printing, and areospace engineering.
